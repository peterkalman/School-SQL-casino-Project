The database project I made in 13th class while studying for my Technician degree.
We were tasked with making a database for a facility of some kind , so I wanted to do something unusual , I made a working casino database.
The database is capable of holding all the administrative information, games and potential or unwanted customers. 
I also made some queries that could detect cheating by the clients, this means that mid-game if cheating is detected (assuming everything is logged) some of those customers would
be moved to the 'black' list where they would have a certain time period to return their stolen winnings.
This repository contains an entire project document and the functional database with queries..
